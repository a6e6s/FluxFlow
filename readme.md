# FluxFlow: Simple-Powerful Project & Kanban Organizer

FluxFlow is a high-productivity dashboard designed to bridge the gap between high-level ideation and granular execution. It uses a "Strategic Sidebar" for project management and a "Tactical Kanban" for task execution.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy
- **Minimalist Friction:** No complex forms; drag-and-drop is the primary language.
- **Visual Context:** Priority is seen through color, icons, and "glow" states.
- **Single Source of Truth:** A unified view where projects and tasks live side-by-side.

## 🛠 Features
### 1. The Dynamic Sidebar (Project Layer)
- **Draggable Hierarchy:** Reorder projects to redefine priority manually.
- **Visual Identity:** Custom icons and color tabs for each project.
- **Project Progress:** Real-time percentage rings showing completion.
- **The Vault (Archive):** A dedicated, collapsible section for completed or paused projects to keep the main workspace clean.

### 2. The Fluid Kanban (Task Layer)
- **Enhanced Task Cards:** Cards include priority badges, due-date countdowns, and "complexity" markers.
- **Quick-Edit Triggers:** Edit details without leaving the board via slide-over panels.
- **Status Sync:** Dragging a task to "Done" automatically updates the Sidebar progress ring.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Laravel 12
- **Frontend:** Livewire 3 (Interactivity), Alpine.js (Animations), Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- **Drag & Drop:** SortableJS / Livewire Sortable plugin
- **Database:** SQLite (for simplicity) or MySQL
